# Jhonson Method of Job Scheduling

The Jhonson Method of Job Scheduling is an algorithm used to find the optimum way to order a set of jobs in a two-machine environment, where each job has a processing time on both machines. The algorithm aims to minimize the total processing time and determine the ideal scheduling of jobs on the machines.

This project provides an implementation of the Jhonson Method of Job Scheduling algorithm in [programming language]. Given a set of n jobs and m machines, the code calculates the optimal order of the jobs and determines the total processing time required.

## Features

- Calculates the optimal order of jobs for a two-machine environment
- Determines the total processing time for the job schedule
- Provides an efficient solution for minimizing processing time

# Usage
This code implies the Jhonson Method of Job Scheduling in a Streamlit app. The app allows users to enter the number of jobs and machines, and then input the processing times for each job on each machine. The app then calculates the optimal order of jobs, determines the ideal time of the machines, and calculates the total processing time required.
